# Python Calculator with GUI

This is a simple Python-based calculator application with a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**. The calculator supports basic and advanced math operations, allowing users to interact with it in a user-friendly way using the `tkinter` library.

---

## Features

The calculator includes the following operations:

1. **Addition**  
2. **Subtraction**  
3. **Multiplication**  
4. **Division** (with error handling for division by zero)  
5. **Modulus**  
6. **Exponentiation**  
7. **Square Root** (supports positive numbers only)  
8. **Factorial** (for non-negative integers)  
9. **Percentage Calculation**  

---

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x** (Tested on Python 3.8 and above)
- No additional libraries are needed (uses built-in libraries like `tkinter` and `math`).

---

## How to Run the Calculator

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-link>
   cd <repo-folder>
   ```

2. Run the Python file:

   ```bash
   python calculator_gui.py
   ```

3. The calculator window will appear. Follow these steps:
   - Enter the **first number**.
   - Enter the **second number** (if applicable).
   - Choose an operation from the dropdown menu.
   - Click the **Calculate** button to see the result.

## Error Handling

The application handles invalid inputs gracefully:
- Division by zero shows an error message.
- Square root and factorial operations validate input (e.g., no negative numbers for square root).
